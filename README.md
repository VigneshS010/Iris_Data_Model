# Iris Flower Classification Project

This repository contains code for a machine learning project aimed at classifying iris flowers into three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. The project uses the famous Iris dataset and demonstrates how to apply various machine learning techniques to classify the flowers based on their features.

## Dataset

The **Iris dataset** is a well-known dataset used for pattern recognition tasks. It contains 150 samples, each with four features:
- Sepal length
- Sepal width
- Petal length
- Petal width

Each sample belongs to one of three species:
- Iris Setosa
- Iris Versicolor
- Iris Virginica

The dataset is included in this repository as `iris.data`.

## Project Structure

- `iris.data`: The Iris dataset.
- `main.py`: The main Python script for training and evaluating the machine learning models.
- `README.md`: Documentation for the project.
